			<br /><br />Breakaway: 1977 by R. M. Kozan 
			<br /><br />Imprint: Fresh Blue Ink Publication Date: 13 September 2013
			<br /><br />What would happen if you were suddenly cut off from the one lifeline that kept you sane in an unbearable situation? Lionel O Neill is forced to wander hostile environments and alien situations as his life deteriorates and a cold, menacing existential void craves his bones.
			<br /><br />Autumn 1976: Lionel is convinced that a youth-oriented social movement will evolve into the next wave of counter-Status Quo conscience. This century-spanning epistolary tale of devotion and madness reveals the teenagers of 1977 to be just as media and music-obsessed as modern youth.
			<br /><br />These middle-school diaries and audio transcripts document teenage angst and delusion, the adolescent conflict between free will and destiny, and ultimately, outline a subtly satiric murder mystery amid a context of science fiction fandom.
			<br /><br />Contains detailed analyses of Space: 1999 episodes, a previously unreleased interview with Barry Morse, plus the secrets of potatoes.
			<br /><br />Breakaway: 1977 takes place in 1970s Saskatchewan and concerns three teenagers in the throes of identity formation who form a close bond due to their mutual social ostracism and love of science, science fiction, philosophy, and heavy rock music. Their fascination with the British TV series Space: 1999 is strongly evident.
			<br /><br />Breakaway: 1977 traces the downward trajectory of character Lionel O&rsquo;Neill, a very intelligent and sensitive teenager from a troubled home. When his much-loved older brother Jerry disappears, Lionel suspects his own secrets might have played a role. Thus begins his descent into madness and murder.
			<br /><br />Breakaway: 1977 consists of diary entries, transcripts of recorded conversations (some surreptitious), summaries and commentaries on particular Space: 1999 episodes, plus later-day commentaries by the three teenagers at various points in their adult lives. The final entry is from the year 2077.
